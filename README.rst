=============
Mr.Gutenberg
=============

is an buildout recipe which will install and setup `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_ following the Documentation Guildlines of the Plone Foundation for your Project.
The aim of mr.gutenberg is to make documentation so painless as possible for
developers.

What is does:
-------------
mr.gutenberg will install Sphinx and will do the setup. You will end up with a
folder called ''docs'' in you buildout, this folder contains Sphinx and all
related files and config.
Further will you have now some boilerplate templates, which make it easier to
write documentation.
mr.gutenberg will create a index.rst which will be filled with base date out of
your setup.py like the Author, Description and so on.

**This is pretty much WIP and not fully working yet !!!**
